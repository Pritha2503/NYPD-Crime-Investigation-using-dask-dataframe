# NYPD-Crime-Investigation-using-dask-dataframe
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the crime data from the New York Police Department (NYPD) to identify crime trends, patterns, and correlations. The dataset contains a large volume of crime records, which are processed and analyzed using Dask, a parallel computing framework that scales efficiently across multiple CPUs and even clusters. Dask DataFrames allow us to process large datasets that might not fit into memory, making them ideal for big data processing tasks.

The analysis includes various crime categories, dates, locations, and types of incidents reported in New York City. The project will provide insights into crime distribution, time-based trends, and spatial patterns across different precincts of NYC.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Load, clean, and preprocess large crime datasets efficiently using Dask DataFrame.

Crime Trend Analysis: Identify patterns in crime occurrences by year, month, and type.

Geospatial Analysis: Analyze crime occurrences based on geographic location (precincts, boroughs, etc.).

Visualization: Generate insights using interactive visualizations with Dask and other libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Scalable Computation: Utilize Dask to process datasets that do not fit into memory, allowing scalable analysis.

Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between crime categories, precincts, and other features.
